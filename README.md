- I’m @65-Roses. I also go by Benny. I'm a terminally ill boy just trying his best.
- I’m interested in far too many things to list here, but I will say I have a burning passion for english literature, gaming, tech, and programming or just coding in general.
- I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, C++, and JavaScript
- Pronouns: He/Him (although I don't feel I belong to any gender category)
- Fun fact: I'm a triplet and I was my elementary school's cup stacking champion

- I have no friends save my wonderful siblings, so if anyone would like to talk my discord is the only messaging I feel comfortable enough to share:
- user: 65_roses
- My discord pfp is of my favorite author, George Orwell.
